Implementing Artificial Intelligence in Mobile Video Gaming— Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive Procedural Content Generation

This is a 3D mobile video game I developed as my Capstone Project during my undergraduate degree in Information Technology at Deree: The American College of Greece. This video game is implementing an AI agent using reinforcement learning that is capable of studying and analyzing the player’s behavior and gameplay habits, in order to adapt the difficulty of the procedural content generator accordingly and allow the 3D map to dynamically generate and transform itself in order to make it easier or more challenging for the user.
